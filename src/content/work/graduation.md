For my brother Grant's graduation, I created a personalized poster that celebrated his academic achievements and captured his personality. This project allowed me to combine my design skills with my love for meaningful, personalized art.

The poster features a carefully curated selection of photographs from Grant's academic journey, arranged in a dynamic layout that tells his story. I chose a color palette that reflected both the formal nature of graduation and Grant's vibrant personality, incorporating his school colors while maintaining a sophisticated overall aesthetic.

Typography played a key role in this design, with his name and graduation year featured prominently in a modern, bold typeface. I balanced these statement elements with more subtle design details and decorative elements that added depth and visual interest to the composition.

This project was particularly special as it combined professional design principles with personal touches, creating a memorable keepsake that honored this important milestone in my brother's life.
